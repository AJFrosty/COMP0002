# Computer Science University Course 🎓🖥️

Welcome to my Computer Science journey at The University of the West Indies! This repository documents my progress, projects, and notes throughout my Computer Science course. Here, you'll find various folders and topics related to my studies and explorations in the field of computer science.

## Directory 📁

### 1. [Revision](./Revision) 📚

- In this folder, I maintain notes, summaries, and practice exercises related to various topics covered in the Previous Computer Science Course (COMP0001). These resources help me revise and reinforce my understanding of key concepts.

### 2. [Object Oriented Programming](./Object-Oriented%20Programming%20(OOP)) 💻

- The Object Oriented Programming (OOP) folder contains my assignments, code samples, and projects related to the OOP paradigm. Here, I apply OOP principles to solve real-world problems and build software applications.

### 3. [Data Structures](./Data%20Structures) 📊

- In this folder, I explore data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. I implement these data structures in python and use them in algorithms and applications.

### 4. [Lab 1](./Lab%201) 🧬

- In this folder, I completed Lab #1 of my Computer Science Course which focuses on Classes and UML Diagrams.

### 5. [Lab 2](./Lab%202) 🌡️

- In this folder, I finished Lab #2 of my Computer Science Course which focuses on Abstract Data Typrd (ADTS) such as Linked Lists, Queues and Stacks.

### 6. [Miscellaneous Content](./Miscellaneous) 📠

- In this folder, I focused on operations with files in Python as well as Exceptions in Python.


## Notes 📝

- My notes, lecture summaries, and useful resources are stored in the respective topic folders for easy access and reference.
